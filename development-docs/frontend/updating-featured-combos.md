## Updating Featured Combos on Home Page

To update what combos are designated as featured, update the script at [scripts/download-data/is-featured.ts](../../scripts/download-data/is-featured.ts). This will typically be the set codes for whatever the most recent sets are.

In addition, go to the [Home page component](../../pages/index.vue) and update the button text to be relevant for whatever combos are being featured.
