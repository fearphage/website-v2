# Frontend App Setup

The frontend is managed by [Nuxt@v2](https://nuxtjs.org/) using the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/).

## Installation Requirements

Install [Node v14](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install the `npm` command line tool.

If you are already using the [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) tool, you can run `nvm install` in the directory to get the correct version of node.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000, specify PORT=<whatever> to change the port
$ npm run dev
```

If you want to see how the app will behave in production, build and run it:

```
# build for production and launch server
$ npm run generate
$ npm run start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
