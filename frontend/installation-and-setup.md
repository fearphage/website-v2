# Frontend App Setup

The frontend uses [Nuxt@v2](https://nuxtjs.org/) to create the app.

## Installation Requirements

See the [Getting Started instructions](../README.md#getting-started) for details about installing node.

## Build Setup

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000, specify PORT=<whatever> to change the port
$ npm run dev
```

If you want to see how the app will behave in production, build and run it:

```bash
# build for production (this will take a while)
$ npm run build-frontend
# runs the site in prod mode using the generated pages from the build-frontend step
$ npm start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
