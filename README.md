# Development Docs

This documentation is rendered as a website on [GitHub Pages](https://commander-spellbook.github.io/website-v2/). Any change to markdown files will be deployed after it gets merged into the `main` branch.

## Getting Started

The site requires [node v16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm 8 (which comes installed with node@16) to run locally, since it utilizes [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) to structure the repo.

If you are already using the [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) tool, you can run `nvm install` in the directory to get the correct version of node.

Once you have installed node, you can install the project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
